I took the leap to change my career and write code for a living as I am curious to know how far I can push my creativity in technology and what I can achieve within the next couple of years. It also helps that I love the creation process and building out my own ideas whilst taking the time to continuously learn new knowledge. 

**Technologies that I have worked with include;**
- **Software Development:** Kotlin and Android Studios
- **AWS:** EC2, VPC, Subnets, Routing, ELB, Auto-Scaling, S3, IAM, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cloud Formation, CloudFront, CloudWatch (need a refresher but i know the basics)
- **SysOps:** Bash Scripting,  AWS CLI, Boto3, Python (a bit rusty as I donâ€™t use these much)

My previous experience includes five years in the Social Housing sector. The main focus in my roles have been customer research, user insight and working with a variety of key stakeholders to improve frontline services in Housing. This has given me a great deal of knowledge in customer consultations and working with wider teams to deliver more customer-centric solutions.

Additionally, I have a STEM related degree in Aircraft Engineering with Pilot Studies. I have also passed my AWS Solutions Architect Associate qualification at the time I was looking into Cloud Infrastructure.

**Get in contact with me for junior 'Android/AWS Developer' roles.**
